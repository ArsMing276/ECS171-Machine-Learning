# ECS171-Machine-Learning

This is the ECS171 homework repository.

Besides solving many practical machine learning problems with datasets from UCI ML repository, I also implemented many algorithms myself, which include:
1. Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent.
2. Artificial Neural Network with Back-Propagation.
3. SVM with Sequential Minimal Optimization
